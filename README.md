# Raspberry-Pi-Button-Game

This is a raspberry pi button game. The computer picks a random number between 1-30 and players who green and blue try to keep far away from this number. Teams can press the button 1 time or 2 times. When players come closer the number red light and buzzer give warning! And who pushes the button when the number on the counter coincides with the random number, that loser!
